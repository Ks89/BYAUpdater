# BYAUpdater

**A software to auto-update [BYAManager](https://github.com/Ks89/BYAManager)**. <br>
This is a small software to update and relunch "BYAManager.jar", the executable of BYAManager. The logic in this software is very simple, but extremely useful.
<br><br>
BYAUpdater can't work alone. You need to use [BYAManager](https://github.com/Ks89/BYAManager) with this software. Obviously, you can update [BYAManager](https://github.com/Ks89/BYAManager) with BYAUpdater only if a new version is available.

## Usage
You can't execute BYAUpdater with a "double-click" on the ".jar". 
There are two ways to use this software:
- Automatic: [BYAManager](https://github.com/Ks89/BYAManager) calls BYAUpdater automatically without user intervention;
- Command Line Interface: You can start BYAUpdater with: 
```java
    $ java -jar BYAUpdater.jar BYAManager.jar <folder of BYAUpdater.jar>
```
